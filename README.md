# population_gravity

### A model to downscale urban and rural population for a defined state to a 1 km grid

## Overview
The `population_gravity` model allocates aggregate urban and rural populations for a defined region to grid cells within that region. In the IM3 application, the model is applied to US state-level urban and rural populations, which are allocated to 1 km grid cells within states. Allocation to grid cells is based on the relative suitability of each cell. Suitability is calculated using a gravity-based approach, in which the suitability of a given cell is determined by the population of surrounding cells (100 km radius), their distance away, and two parameters, namely alpha and beta. Alpha and beta are estimated based on historical population data and indicate the importance of returns to scale and distance in determining suitability values of cells, respectively. The model is composed of two components: calibration and projection. The calibration component uses historical urban/rural population grids of each state in 2000 and 2010 and an optimization algorithm to estimate the alpha and beta parameters that minimize the absolute difference between the actual population grid in 2010 and the one derived from the model. The two parameters can be modified to reflect distinctive forms of population development that may be desired in different socio-economic scenarios. Once the parameters are defined, the projection component downscales state-level urban/rural population aggregates of each state from 2020 to 2100 under different scenarios to grid cells within the state.

## Getting Started
The `population_gravity` package uses only **Python 3.6** and up.

### Step 1:
You can install `population_gravity` from GitHub by running the following from your terminal:

`python -m pip install -e git://github.com/IMMM-SFA/population_gravity.git@main#egg=population_gravity`

### Step 2:
Confirm that the module and its dependencies have been installed by running from your prompt:

```python
import population_gravity
```

If no error is returned then you are ready to go!

### Generate calibration parameters
If the calibration has not yet been conducted, follow **Example 2** to generate calibration parameters for a target state.

### Expected outputs
Each downscaling run will output a raster for urban, rural, and total population count for each 1 km grid cell for the target state.  These will be written to where the `output_directory` has been assigned.

Each calibration run will output a CSV file containing the calibration parameters for the target state and scenario.  These will be written to where the `output_directory` has been assigned.
